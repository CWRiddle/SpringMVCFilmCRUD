### Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D.

### Overview
This project utilizes a database of information allowing users to create, read,
update, and delete data all with a simplistic user friendly interface.

### How To Use
When running this project you will be taken to the home page. Here you will find
links to either find a film by ID number, add a new film, as well as a search bar to find
a list of movies by keyword. Make your selection and you will be redirected to a
different page correlating to the action you wish to do. If you select find by ID you
will find a search bar which will return a list of information from the desired
film along with the ability to edit or delete it. With the add a film option you
will be taken to a page with several empty bars pertaining to all relevant film
information. If you decide to search by keyword you will be shown a list of films
matching the keyword along with buttons to either edit a film or delete it. At the
top of each page you will also find a navigation bar to allow you to easily transition
from page to page.

### Lessons Learned (Pos/Neg)
Positive: This project was quite intimidating from the start, we have learned a lot
of information this past week and a half HOWEVER, that being said, coming the end of
this project I feel as though a lot of concepts have really solidified themselves
in my mind after applying them in this project.
Negative: As stated above this project was intimidating as its our first one like
this. Applying so many new concepts in a single project was rough trying to get things
to work together and play nice. We kept on trucking forward solving a problem at a time.
Grateful for this opportunity and excited to see what the following weeks bring!
